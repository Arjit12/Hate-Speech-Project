# Hate-Speech-Project
Hate speech is defined as speech that attacks a person or a group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

## Why is hate speech so dangerous?

Some have argued that inflammatory public speech increases before outbreaks of mass violence, which could suggest that hate speech is a precursor or even a prerequisite for violence.Words, name-calling, hateful phrases, casual racist comments - they all have an impact, especially if those words become convincing to a large number of people.
# Project: Hate speech detection on social media using data science
## Motivation

Hate speech is an unfortunately common occurrence on the Internet. Often social media sites like Facebook and Twitter face the problem of identifying and censoring problematic posts while weighing the right to freedom of speech. The importance of detecting and moderating hate speech is evident from the strong connection between hate speech and actual hate crimes. Early identification of users promoting hate speech could enable outreach programs that attempt to prevent an escalation from speech to action. Sites such as Twitter and Facebook have been seeking to actively combat hate speech.

## Problem statement

The dataset contains tweets categorized as "Offensive (racism/sexism)" labelled as 1 and "Not offensive" labelled as 0. This dataset contains around 50k tweets split into training and testing data

## Objective

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
